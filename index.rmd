## Assignment

This is an R Markdown presentation as part of the final project of Developing Data Products course at Coursera.com. Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch. 

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. 

- Create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. 
- Use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application.

## Shiny Application

- Name of the App: **Location of Top FL Private High Schools**
- Purpose of the App: *To help international students to choose a private high school in Florida based on the ranking and location of the school.*
- Input of the App: Use a **Slider** to select the **Ranking** of the school in FL.
- Output of the App: a **Interactive Map** showing the street location of the school. The map can be zoomed in and out. The school **Name**, **Ranking**, **Address**, **Telephone**, and **Home Page** are also displaced on the main panel.
- `ui.R` and `server.R` code: The code of `ui.R` and `server.R` can be found here [link](https://github.com/smei1227/developingDataProductFinalProject).
- App: Try the `Application` here [link](https://smei1227.shinyapps.io/FLprivateHighSchoolRank/).
